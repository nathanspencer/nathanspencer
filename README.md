About this project:
This is my personal website. Except for the 3rd party brand icons, all iconography was done by me using Adobe Illustrator. The site itself was built using Bootstrap v4.

Dependencies:
To provide a fast experience for visitors, I used the Bootstrap CDN. I also used the following:

*Google fonts API: Russo One & Open Sans

*Font Awesome CDN

*Animate CSS CDN
